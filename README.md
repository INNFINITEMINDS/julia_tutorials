# Intro to Julia for Statistics
This repo houses the materials for a class session on using Julia for statistics. The Dockerfile can be used to create a Debian image with Anaconda Python 3.6, Julia 0.5.1, and R 3.3.2. Also included in this Debian image are many of the more popular packages for these languages (e.g., Scikit-Learn, ggplot2, Rcpp, lme4, PlotlyJS.jl, Cxx.jl, RCall.jl).
